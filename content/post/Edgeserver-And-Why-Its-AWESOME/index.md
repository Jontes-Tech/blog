# What the hell is Edgeserver?
Before I've used stuff like Cloudflare Pages, Netlify and Vercel, but all of them are big big corporations who wants your data. I found out the guys over in [devtalk](https://discord.gg/CuwUgSdQTp) are developing a GPL 3, selfhostable, lets you log in securely without email nor password and performant alternative. AND IT SUPPORTS IPFS (soonâ„¢).

# Conclusion
I want to thank the guys over at Devtalk for letting me access the application on their server, since I can't really selfhost anything. Also just generally thank you for writing this application, I'm looking forward to seeing the future of the thingy. Well since I'm not that good at writing I will end the article here but down below there's their twitter and github pages. Peace.
