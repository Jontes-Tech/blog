# The letter Ï€
## What's Pi Day?
Today it's the 14th of March, AKA 2022-3-14. That's the first few decimals of Pi.
## But why do we celebrate it?!
It's a fancy number that "never ends". But 1/3 (0.333333333333333 forever). Is it because it's random? So is Phi AKA the golden ratio. Why do we celebrate it then? Because it has a nice name like "Pi" that sounds like the word "pie?!"
