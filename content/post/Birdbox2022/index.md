# Why?
Yesteryear I tried making a Livestreaming Birdbox, and that was... A total failure. Cool. That was with a Raspberry Pi Zero W, which performed incredibly badly. But now with a Reolink camera I can get 1440p (Yet choose 720p because of the internet speed in the deployment location)

# Building Process:
The building process can be read [here](../planning-for-birdbox2022).

# How about the old Birdbox?
Learn about Birdbox 2021 [here](../birdbox2021)

# Conclusion
This website will be updated once I have tested the setup more.
