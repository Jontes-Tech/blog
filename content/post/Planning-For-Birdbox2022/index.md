This year we're going with the Reolink RLC-410W as our main camera, connected with Wifi and to the power grid. We hope that this means this will be a 0 maintenance operation, but I think I just jinxed it. I made a sketch in Blender, but we will also add 2 holes for the antennas to go through. I'll update this post as the project gets more work.

Bye for now.
Jonte.
